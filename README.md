# Indian Sign Language

Indian Sign Language (ISL) is the sign language used primarily in India. Just like spoken languages, ISL has regional variations and dialects that can differ significantly based on the geographical area. It serves as a vital means of communication and interaction for the deaf community across the country.

# Use of Computer Vision in this field has several benefits :-

(1) Practical Communication Aid: It can serve as a practical communication aid for deaf individuals in various scenarios, such as interactions with healthcare professionals, customer service representatives, and public service announcements.

(2) Education Support: Integrating sign language recognition into educational tools and platforms can provide valuable support for deaf students, helping them understand and engage with educational content more effectively.

(3) Community Empowerment: Empowering the deaf community with technology that recognizes and understands sign language can enhance their sense of independence, self-confidence, and inclusivity.

(4) Accessible Information: The technology can make information more accessible to the wider public, promoting a better understanding of sign language and deaf culture.

# MobileNet

MobileNet is a popular deep learning architecture known for its efficiency and compact size, making it well-suited for mobile and embedded devices with limited computational resources. 
The version used here, contains Convolutional layers, Activation layers, BatchNormalization layers and MaxPooling layers.
And it was trained on ImageNet dataset.

# Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained neural network, like MobileNet, is used as a starting point for training a new model on a different task or dataset.
